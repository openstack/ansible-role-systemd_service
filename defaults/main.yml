# Global Environment variables for system services.
#  This option will provide the operator a way to set additional environment options
#  used within the execution of a given service. Environment variables can be passed
#  into the service using ADHOC options or through a given environment file. If both
#  options are specified, and a collision occurs options will be set in the order in
#  which they are read (top to bottom) with a given file being processed last.
#
#  If the `systemd_environment_file` is defined a file will be read into the systemd service

# The `systemd_environment_file` option is a string. The full path to a given file must be used.

# The systemd services dictionary is a set of services that will be created. The dictionary
#  can contain the following options:
#  `service_name` -- (required) used to define the name of the service. This is typically the name of the executable.
#  `service_type` -- (optional) Set the service type, default is "simple".
#  `execstarts` -- (required) Set the program to start, when the service is simple the list has a max length of 1.
#  `execstops` -- (optional) Set the program to stop, when the service is simple the list has a max length of 1.
#  `after_targets` -- (optional) Start the service after this list of dependency units.
#  `partof` -- (optional) Set the systemd "partof" directive. This ties a service unit to another.
#  `config_overrides` -- (optional) This allows any section or key=value pair to be set within the systemd unit file.
#  `program_sandboxing` -- (optional) Case sensitive Key=Value pairs for service Sandboxing
#  `program_accounting` -- (optional) Case sensitive Key=Value pairs for service Accounting
#  `enabled` -- (optional) Set the enabled state of the service.
#  `state` -- (optional) Set the running state of the service.
#  `environment` -- (optional) set additional environment settings, this option is a hash of strings.
#  `environment_file` -- (optional) set additional environment settings through a given file. this option is a string.
#  `dynamic_user` -- (optional) Dynamically set a UNIX user and group when the unit is started; only works if systemd >= 235.
#  `state_directory` -- (optional) Relative path the state directory; only works if systemd >= 235.

# Under the service dictionary the "timer" key can be added which will enable a given service
#  as a timer (Legacy cron job).
#  `options` -- (optional) This allows any section or key=value pair to be set within the systemd timer file.
#  `cron_minute` -- (optional) This allows for "on calendar configuration" (AKA CRON) for the minute segment.
#  `cron_hour` -- (optional) This allows for "on calendar configuration" (AKA CRON) for the hour segment.
#  `cron_day` -- (optional) This allows for "on calendar configuration" (AKA CRON) for the day segment.
#  `cron_weekday` -- (optional) This allows for "on calendar configuration" (AKA CRON) for the weekday segment.
#  `cron_month` -- (optional) This allows for "on calendar configuration" (AKA CRON) for the month segment.
